    <h1>mathematics and motivation</h1>
    <p>necessarily also some thoughts about the UK's education system</p>
  <h2>thoughts and feelings</h2>
    <p>i consider myself an amateur mathematician before a student of maths, even though i am also the latter and have incurred a <abbr title="to some extent more than i could have comprehended when i first made the decision surrounded by school encouraging me, whom i since realised knew little about what they they were getting into">significant amount of debt</abbr> to be so</p>
    <p>i had <abbr title="with gender, family, etc. (the standard things)">a lot of problems</abbr> during A-levels from which i distracted myself (with programming and olympiadry and other things that weren't part of the UK's A-level course and as such weren't going to be considered at all by universities)</p>
    <p>part of this was because i was fundamentally unable to bring myself to engage with the teachers and the course; i was <abbr title="i believe this started before i even met them! the school had written an EHCP (educational healthcare plan) for me, with the aim of extracting money from some government department, and as such exaggerated the extent to which i was disabled/in need of help; specifically, they wrote me as a conceited and arrogant figure, which i realise in retrospect is quite clever; it allows them to exaggerate things as much as they want, while also being unactionable to excuse their lack of action. anyway, the most direct effect this had upon me was my teachers all read it, and unlike my physics teachers (who had spent years with me occasionally looking at my personal projects), the maths ones took its claims at face value, predetermining their dispositions">disliked</abbr> by my maths teachers, and they ran a tight ship, by which i mean did not permit any time for the asking of questions not immediately helpful to the course.</p>
    <p>the A-level syllabus is quite curious; it <i>appears as though</i> it's a single specification uniform across both state and private schools, but there is a pattern present in both maths and physics; private schools hire people with significantly more background in an area (ie. people with MScs or PhDs who command higher salaries), those people want to cover the 'most interesting' modules (that provide the most leeway for them to convey pieces of intuition and problem-solving and functionally complete grasps of cool cohesive theories), the state schools already teaching those get outcompeted and switch to the modules less conducive to that</p>
    <p>this is why it's somewhat more difficult to find a state school covering additional pure maths or astrophysics, and why they almost always do mechanics and statistics</p>
    <p>as this process iterates and the disparity entrenches itself, the state schools lose all motivation they might have had to teach by conveying intuition and theories, reducing maths into a collection of rote applications of facts, with the goal changed to learning the maximum number of facts</p>
  <h2>'plug and chug'</h2>
    <p>this is a term i've seen in math.se to deride "plug the parameters into the algorithm, run it manually, and write down the answer it churns out" questions; these are seen as <abbr title="i am somewhat biased because i spend most of my time trawling the historical questions rather than the new ones; they're less of a problem currently since the Enforcement of Quality Standards project began and disincentivised them in 2021, and since ChatGPT became a more convenient homework fulfilment machine in 2022">the worst kind</abbr> there, since they're almost always duplicates and almost never come with any demonstration of effort on the part of the asker, because any modicum of effort would be sufficient to proceed.</p>
    <p>the dichotomy of plug-and-chug vs. interesting questions isn't <i>inherently</i> tied to the subjects of modules; there is a lot of interesting statistics to do (see <wi-ki href=Random_permutation_statistics>the Wikipedia page on random permutation statistics</wi-ki>), the methods for which are <abbr title="would require use of tools more general than it currently contains; making the jump to it from A-levels benefits from a grasp of generating functions, but the statistics module no longer contains moment generating functions.">omitted</abbr>, leading to the subject as taught being useful neither as a basis for further advancement of maths nor for blind practitionry.</p>
  <h2>what university seems to be like in the majority of the UK</h2>
    <p>my uni differs significantly from the average in a few ways, but i don't believe any are meaningful here; it's relatively strong in physical sciences and has its campus conjoined to a research park, and its administration makes <abbr title="commissioning the construction of new suites of teaching/accommodation buildings to serve Chinese international students (the most lucrative kind), before being hit by a pandemic whose main lasting effect is a significant decrease to the Chinese internationalstudentship rate">poor financial decisions</abbr> leading to layoffs while still paying the Vice Chancellor ≈9 times the median UK salary</p>
    <p>the maths dept. seems pretty good for research in the subjects it specialises in, though i'm unqualified to assess it, being that it's the only one i've ever seen and most of the contents of research seminars are over my head; however, i can talk about the undergraduate course</p>
    <p>i won't go over the contents so much as the omissions</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>the statistics module carries most of the same problems as A-levels</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>in particular, there is a set of univariate distributions to memorise, and the parameters are given their common names without explanation of why they bear those names; the very first thing i would write in an introduction to a distribution would be the idealised model that it describes exactly, but as soon as it gets to the gamma distribution this just stops!</p>
        <blockquote>It is a two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions. It has a shape parameter \(\alpha>0\) and a scale parameter \(\beta>0\). The gamma distribution is frequently a probability model for waiting times; for instance, in life testing, the waiting time until death is a random variable that is frequently modeled with a gamma distribution.</blockquote>
        <p>or</p>
        <blockquote>Student’s \(t\)-distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, like the normal distribution, but has heavier tails, meaning that it is more prone to producing values that fall far from its mean; see Figure 1.1. [...] A final characteristic of the \(t\) distribution is that as \(\nu\) gets larger, the \(t\) gets closer to the standard normal.</blockquote>
        <p>these are somewhat okay qualitative descriptions but lack epistemological motivation and so become useless! what <i>are</i> they? what object is lifespan like, which the gamma function models perfectly? a student would be forgiven for imagining that research statistics is largely comprised of dreaming up new arbitrary arrangements of symbols into formulas and performing least-squares tests to see how well they fit sets of data</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>with linear algebra and complex analysis, i have found myself learning about things for my own work (residues, saddle point approximation, <oeis-tally href=linear_recurrence>generalised eigenvectors</oeis-tally>) around a year before being 'taught' them, which makes the fact that i pay so much money to be here immensely frustrating</dt>
      <dd>i often will learn something and wonder how it managed to pass me by when it's such a quintessential part of understanding an object that i must have spent tens of hours being 'taught' about, and</dd>
      <dt>differential equations did have a few general methods taught somewhat conceptually, but also a lot of ad-hoc ones that felt like they were being included to make the syllabus larger <i>as the ultimate end goal</i> rather than to serve as useful tools for doing research; for certain very specific kinds of research they would, but for most they are superseded in an actual research context by use of computer algebra systmes</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>despite being so agonisingly aware of these problems, i'm unsure how to fix them; however, the two main causes are lack of passion among the teachers, and a focus on making exams that don't leave students behind (my uni's Wikipedia page notes its suspiciously high portion of first-class degrees awarded, which is not just sleight-of-hand but requires the point distributions themselves to be a certain way for their grade boundaries to meet regulations while being first-heavy). often the lecture notes are bastardisations of previous versions, that wantonly cut out pieces deemed unnecessary towards the teaching-testing cycle</p>
  <h2>friends' experiences in (the minority of the UK)/elsewhere</h2>
    <p>i have a lot of friends with interests in maths, whose unis are often more befitting to their interests, and i've discussed courses with them at great length; i've even had one disguise their coursework as questions borne out of genuine curiosity to try to get me to give them the critical piece of insight they were missing, and the fact that they <i>could</i> do this plausibly is a testament to good course design!</p>
    <p>my friends in Germany (and most in EU countries in general) have considerably different experiences; German unis have <abbr title="from a cursory internet search; another result said 47%, may be inaccurate">about a 34% dropout rate for maths</abbr>, mostly during the first year and serving as an <abbr title="which appeals to me; the situation in the UK is that classes are explicitly taught about the entrance exams but only at private schools, which this remediates">alternative to entrance exams</abbr>. Unis in the UK system cannot implement this, since they stand to lose money by letting students drop out; much alike <wi-ki href=No_Child_Left_Behind_Act#Gifted_students>No Child Left Behind</wi-ki>, they are forced to water things down to maximise retention!</p>
  <h2>the vast unimaginable dissonance</h2>
    <p>i hold very strong conviction in some somewhat idiosyncratic views on what constitutes maths; for instance, it is possible to stumble upon 'deep' results by playing around in the Python shell, or PARI/GP or even WolframScript! (see <a href=Notamathematician.html>my page on Notamathematician</a>, who is particularly proficient at this)</p>
    <p>i consider my page <oeis-tally href=on_nearsighted_binary_counters></oeis-tally> to be <abbr title="even if it ultimately only serves as a (particularly nice) explicit construction for textbooks to mention as a tangent">one of my most significant contributions to maths</abbr>, and i arrived upon most of it years before writing that page; much of <abbr title="it grew out of a footnote to a short table of generating functions for the evolutions of range-1 1DCA from a single cell">the pattern-recognition part</abbr> (before getting to proofs), at least, i completed before even starting uni</p>
    <p>and it frustrated me that all the skills necessary to complete it (that i learned on-the-fly) are so enormously distant from everything my uni has taught (which in comparison amount largely to a bunch of trivia interchangeable with any other trivia)</p>
    <p>i sympathise greatly with Doron Zeilberger, whose <a href=https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/OPINIONS.html>opinions</a> often revolve around what he terms experimental math, prioritising the discoveries above the formalisations and proofs, which he sees as ultimately secondary; i agree, that although endeavouring to prove something can lead to considering new things and developing new theory, it isn't the only way, and it shouldn't be uniquely prized on a pedestal all of its own and treated as the only way to approach things by textbooks</p>
    <p>but teaching the art of meandering in a classroom environment is harder than in textbooks, especially when the class is comprised of people who haven't sought out to learn it</p>
    <p>but my uni experience has been only a vague shadow of the proof-based approach to maths; it is the plug-and-chug approach, which inherently cannot be maths and cannot produce mathematicians</p>
  <h2>partial justifications i've heard</h2>
    <p>i spoke with a professor who had been part of the same system from the other side (having been called on to pick up and temporarily teach modules that they admitted they saw glaring holes in).</p>
    <p>we were talking primarily about <abbr title="this is a matter of contention for me; I'm told most unis don't impose uniform page limits by default and that it's usually left to the supervisor but here they stipulate 20 pages (or 40 if one drops an additional module for some incomprehensible reason), and require use of a template with more spacing than default">the dissertation programme</abbr>, but they mentioned that all the standard project plans therein were erring on the side of summarising literature and exhibiting proofs of known results because (at least in <abbr title="they are a fluid mechanicist by trade, if that makes any difference; they taught me first-year calculus but previously taught (but did not prescribe the contents of) second-year differential equations, a module i could write a whole section of this about (it is too focused on cramming in a multitude of ad-hoc techniques over conveying general concepts, which seems particularly backwards in the era of CASs, and is particularly upsetting to me, a generatingfunctionologist)">their field</abbr>) doing original research is risky due to the chance of it either failing to produce useful results or transpiring to be less original than believed</p>
    <p>i like to believe i'm a counterexample to this! here is a very short tour of some of my pages</p>
    <dl>
      <dt></dt>
      <dt><oeis-tally href=on_nearsighted_binary_counters></oeis-tally>: work on the <i>idea</i> started before i entered university; uses the language of ordinary generating functions to express ideas in what would otherwise be done in a clunky roundabout ad-hoc way<!-- (for which it tells you to read <oeis-tally href=linear_recurrence></oeis-tally> which <abbr title="back when it was a LaTeX document due to a particularly pedantic lecturer to whom i occasionally showed drafts who would stop me when i didn't define something to their liking">began as a foreword</abbr>)--> but it was just put together from a page on </dt>
    </dl>
  <h2>things less central to my thesis</h2>
  <h3>problems specific to my school in particular</h3>
    <p>i had the experience of being offered to leave the foreign languages classes to study ICT instead.</p>
    <p>ICT is a fundamentally broken subject here, moreso than all the others; its creation was based on the government deciding that computer literacy was important, then trusting Microsoft to define what computer literacy was (to which, of course, the biggest office program company answered "proficiency with office programs").</p>
    <p>but the school used it to gerrymander the rabble-rousing students away so they'd stop distracting the others; i wasn't disruptive, but was unmotivated (explaining to my teachers that i saw languages as <abbr title="i still hold this attitude to some extent; translation software improves faster than education standards can keep up with and i believe it's made mass education (with the goal of bilingualism by default) redundant; further, my school taught French and German rather than Spanish, which has more speakers than both combined, making the argument of utility more tenuous, and i think the other argument (that it imbues a unique ability to appreciate cultures and art) is flawed too; there are more direct ways to do that and the format of information transmission imbues only a superficial understanding (especially when treated as the central object of study).">routine and pointless</abbr>), so they sent me away too</p>
    <p>however, they had no intention of finishing (or even really starting) the course; it was treated as a daycare, where the 'teacher' sat at her computer using Facebook and the 'students' played whatever Flash games they wanted, with her only piping up to tell them to be quiet when they grew too loud.</p>
    <p><a href=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-maths-and-english-condition-of-funding/2024-to-2025-academic-year-16-to-19-funding-maths-and-english-condition-of-funding>attainment-dependent funding</a> exists, but only to a very slight degree (maintaining a low baseline) for English and maths; assumedly, this was done to prevent it from exacerbating inequality between schools.</p>
    <p>but this makes it stranger that they would go to such underhanded measures to increase their rating; it still is bizarre to me how this could be done by a school with near 2000 pupils!</p>
    <p>it's exactly analogous to a company making a separate entity to transfer its debt to then shut down, which is fraud, and all the Ofsted inspections seem to have missed it!</p>
    <p>also, i experienced at least one case of being placed into a lower class (for geography) based on the teacher for the advanced class vetoing my grades-based placement there due to personal begrudgement; i have no idea how standard this is to do, but i received a grade 8 (out of 9) and only learned that the case studies in the exams were picked from a public list, and that the advanced class was <abbr title="unsure whether this was to give them additional content to drop in (that examiners wanted to see as proof that they'd learned a priori), or to learn the points contained in the exams that they should mention; ">learning them in advance of the exams</abbr>, when a friend in the advanced class informed me, and felt somewhat cheated since the teacher for mine spent most of her time placating us with tenuously-geographical DVDs</p>
  <h3>things that affect me more than they ought to</h3>
    <p>after my first year, the uni was subjected to a 'cyberattack,' the lasting effects of which were</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>the IT department sends out emails diguised as being from Microsoft; opening them displays a faux-login dialogue in a non-Microsoft domain, and irrespective of your behaviour here, they will assign you optional training modules that they pester you about</dt>
      <dt>every single website that requires you to sign in will be automatically signed out after a few hours of inactivity (although i think this may have been the case before) and (more importantly) requires 2FA</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>it's difficult to convey the magnitude of how frustrating this is, here is the timeline of ordeals i must undergo every time i open it</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>i need to retrieve my phone from wherever i put it</dt>
          <dt>the website on my laptop asks me to enter the 3-letter code it shows me into a dialogue in the Outlook iOS app</dt>
          <dt>the Outlook app doesn't bring up this dialogue when pulled down to refresh, i must wait for arbitrarily long for it to appear with no way to expedite it</dt>
          <dt>i give up, and press the "I can't open the Outlook app right now" button, which takes me to another screen</dt>
          <dt>the dialogue gives me an option to receive a text with a 6-digit code to enter into the laptop instead (the other way around from Outlook)</dt>
          <dt>you might expect i am to open up my messages app, since 'text' means SMS by default, but actually i must open WhatsApp</dt>
          <dd>the vast majority of my WhatsApp messages are spam (informing me of arbitrary job offers), so i don't have banner notifications for it, making this difficult to discern (when nowhere on the website mentions WhatsApp's name!)</dd>
          <dt>i must close whatever fullscreen popup telling me to grant WhatsApp more permissions, and open the message (since the message preview doesn't let me see the code beneath the prepended description)</dt>
          <dt>if i have had WhatsApp in the background since the last time i underwent this, and i scrolled up by a miniscule amount, the view will not be locked to the bottom and i must scroll down to see the message</dt>
        </dl>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>the last detail is maybe irrelevant here, but i hate being forced through this process every single time, and it strongly disincentivises anything that requires it for me</p>
    <p>and the website containing coursework and lecture notes (Blackboard) springs me back to its main page from wherever i was when i'm forcibly signed out! i generally browse with a lot of tabs open, vaguely grouped into sections for various things i'm working on (centred around a wiki page or math.se answer i'm writing, with the intention to close all the supplementary tabs once i've constructed something for my future self's reference that either contains their links or distils their contents), a process which often takes multiple weeks. i've found a lot of success with this mode of operation, but i cannot do it with my coursework!</p>
    <p>i'm also frustrated with the Microsoft password dialogue for imposing a slight delay (with a sliding animation and spinner) between each menu; it doesn't need to do this! since it knows i'm trying to sign into my university (which it does since it has a picturesque photograph of the campus in the background), and that the policy is to require 2FA, the interface could be implemented to know to bring up a 2FA dialogue immediately without communicating back and forth to the server (which sometimes takes over a second), or better yet, have it all in a single page.</p>
    <p>Blackboard itself has a problem of the same nature but much much worse; there are ≈1-second-long delays (sometimes longer still) for actions like uncollapsing folders within a module.</p>
    <p>Blackboard also has an 'alternative download formats' button (literally a downward arrow inside a capital A), which is only one click away, while the 'default' download option (as a PDF) is two clicks away in a [...] button</p>
    <p>i attribute all of this horrible experience as my primary cause of procrastination on university studies</p>
    <p>my friends in other unis mostly don't report this! one professor in particular has an archive of past exam papers in their userspace, which is a set of lists of plaintext hyperlinks, which i have appreciated greatly! why can't everything be like this‽</p>
  <h2>further reading</h2>
    <p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Lament><i>A Mathematician's Lament</i></a>, covering somewhat similar themes; i mostly take issue with it for drawing the conclusion that the US math education system (which is mechanically very similar) is the way it is as a result of the importance placed on tests, when from what i've seen there are more layers of reasons beneath that</p>
