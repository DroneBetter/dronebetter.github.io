    <h1>metaguide to transfeminine HRT in the UK</h1>
    <p>a collection of guides and things i have discovered that have been/will be useful to me</p>
    <p>note this is skewed towards England, especially the Londonwards side</p>
    <p>i also recommend <a href=https://diyhrt.wiki>the DIY HRT directory</a></p>
    <h2>free physical resources</h2>
    <h3>London-based hormone blood testing services</h3>
    <p>before having a blood test, ensure you are hydrated (otherwise your blood will be viscous and they will need to poke many holes in you instead of few)</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href=https://cliniq.org.uk/other-cliniq-health-services>cliniQ</a>: open on Tuesdays, operated out of King's College Hospital on Tuesdays 16:00-to-19:00</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>they list liver function tests as a separate service but i'm pretty sure they perform them by default on your first visitation; generally you can just explain whatever your reasoning is to the volunteer taking the test and they will add your desired metric to the order form</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><a href=https://www.dean.st/trans-non-binary-2>56T Dean Street</a>: open on Tuesdays, open on Wednesdays 16:30-to-19:00</dt>
      <dt>note that your GP will also likely be willing to perform the tests as well</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>for both, book in advance via email</p>
    <p>both offer quite similar ranges of services (they also will administer injections if you have proof that they're from prescriptions, and provide screenings/vaccines for STIs)</p>
    <p>transferring records between services operating in different counties is difficult and annoying and unreliable</p>
    <p>cliniQ is willing to provide a recommendation that one's GP offer a 'bridge prescription' but they require an in-person appointment with a doctor to do this; note that unlike blood tests (which they offer to <abbr title="which you may find your visit being classified as if they don't get to your email in time; most recently, this happened to me after notifying them 11 days in advance">walk-ins</abbr>), their doctors are in short supply, and you must book such appointments about 3 months in advance</p>
    <p>if you do get a prescription, it is a good idea to get a <a href=https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs/nhs-hormone-replacement-therapy-prescription-prepayment-certificate-hrt-ppc>HRT prepayment certificate</a>; they cost £19.80 rather than the £9.90 per prescription item, so will save you money if you collect your prescription > twice yearly</p>
    <h2>subcutaneous injection administration guide</h2>
    <p>(written for me by my friend <abbr title="who does not wish for further clarification of her identity beyond her name">sophie</abbr>)</p>
    <p>Supplies needed:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Injection vial </dt>
      <dt>Insulin needles</dt>
      <dd>(recommended 29g 1ml/100 units, but like any insulin needle works)</dd>
      <dt>Sharps disposal bin</dt>
      <dd>(this is not quite necessary, you can get away with using ie. soya milk cartons at least for the duration in which they're stationary)<!--added by me based on further conversation--></dd>
      <dt>70% isopropyl alcohol wipes</dt>
      <dt>Plasters</dt>
      <dd>(very optional)</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Before first ever injection, feel free to practice by injecting water into an orange</p>
    <p>Before injection:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Use 70% IPA wipe on vial stopper</dt>
      <dt>If you feel haven't showered in the past few days use 70% IPA wipe spiralling outwards where you would inject (optional)</dt>
      <dt>Remove the caps of the needle and draw air up to the amount you are injecting (25 units)</dt>
      <dt>Put the needle through the vial stopper</dt>
      <dt>Inject air into the vial</dt>
      <dt>Turn vial upside down</dt>
      <dt>Draw until there's enough fluid in the needle (might need to go up to like 40 units)</dt>
      <dt>Push the air and extra fluid in the needle back in to get to your actual dosage, feel free to tap the needle to help the air out whilst doing this</dt>
      <dt>Remove the needle</dt>
      <dt>if you are using separate needles, put the drawing one into your sharps bin before retrieving your injecting one</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>Injection:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>If you are particularly thin feel free to <abbr title="by which i have since learned she meant pinch; ideally the needle should not go in further than the pinched part is held away from the abdomen">hold</abbr> the skin so that you are easier to inject</dt>
      <dt>Push the needle into the injection site at a 45 degree angle oriented so that the bevel of the needle points up</dt>
      <dt>Inject</dt>
      <dt>Hold needle in for a few seconds</dt>
      <dt>Remove needle</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>After injection:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>If some injection fluid spills out don't worry it's not much, feel free to hold with your finger to stop it coming out</dt>
      <dt>If some blood spills out don't worry you just hit a capillary, feel free to hold with your finger to stop it coming out (you can use a plaster if you want)</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>Do alternate injection sides (like switch between left and right)</p>
    <h2>getting injection equipment</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>if you have an address that can safely receive packages, <a href=https://www.exchangesupplies.org>exchangesupplies.org</a> offers exceedingly cheap supplies</dt>
      <dt>if you do not, <a href=https://www.queerhealth.info/projects/thnx>THNX</a> (17:00-19:00 on the 2nd Monday of each month at Common Press Bookshop in London) provides it for free in person (no booking necessary)</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>once you have said equipment, the expendible parts are either replaceable over-the-counter (ie. IPA wipes) or via Boots's harm reduction needle replacement programme (bring your sharps bin ask at the till)</p>
    <p><a href=https://transharmreduction.org/get-injection-supplies>transharmreduction.org's page</a> gives lists for further needle exchanges in Scotland/Ireland</p>
    <h2>on <abbr title="ie. insulin">fixed</abbr> vs. separate needles</h2>
    <p>from cursory internet searches, one finds what seems to be a pretty decisive consensus in favour of using separate needles</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>metal is malleable, and needles' tips are thin enough for this to be an issue; <abbr title="gel stoppers close the hole upon the needle's departure to avoid contamination">perforating the stopper</abbr> can blunt the tip</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>however, a <abbr title="sorry; she is working on a webpage (with citations) that i will be able to link to here when she's done">brief summary</abbr> of my discussion with an acquaintance more well-versed is</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>needles contain dead space in which for the oil to be stuck and lost when you dispose of them; insulin needles typically have little of this, and are only discarded once instead of twice</dt>
      <dt>less propensity for human error and more consistent doses</dt>
      <dt>fixed needles are generally thin enough that repeated stabbing into a vial's stopper isn't going to <abbr title="disintegrate">core</abbr> it</dt>
      <dd>with those from THNX, this isn't a problem either way</dd>
      <dt>in the event of needle-sharing/accidents, less dead space reduces disease risk</dt>
      <dt>more convenient</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>note that THNX is willing to provide both</p>
    <h2>on subcutaneous vs. intramuscular</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>air bubbles are only a risk in intravenous injections, not either subq or IM</dt>
      <dd>with subq you will only be at risk of hitting capillaries, not larger vessels</dd>
      <dt></dt>
    </dl>
    <h2>personal remarks</h2>
    <p>following my first injection on 2025-10-28</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>i am <abbr title="i have been for most of my life thus far, showing little variance despite the long stretches in which i have eaten as much as my decidedly-not-underweight parents (though i have neglected my diet at other times, which for me manifests as forgetting that my metabolism exists until it causes physical pain); i hope to one day learn whether there's any causative factor besides myself, but my GPs and (distant past) child dieticians were unable to find one">quite underweight</abbr>, which (among other things) makes blood withdrawal upon me <abbr title="this is part of why i emphasise the importance of hydration maybe">significantly harder</abbr>, typically entailing multiple stabs in both arms, and (worst of all) wiggling the needle around after it's already pierced the skin to look for <abbr title="being convex, they slide out of the way; i've been told typically the smaller ones are less prone to this (which is why they're typically gone for) but this doesn't pertain for me">evasive veins</abbr></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>i was under the impression this would make injections into subcutaneous fat harder, but that was not the case at all! initially, my injector was going to try using my leg fat (through the fabric of my leggings), but <abbr title="after remarking 'you're rather small, aren't you?'">ultimately</abbr> chose my abdomen; abdominal fat is always feasible!</p>
        <p>in fact, i had a blood test earlier the same day, of five stabbings, compared to each of which it was quite painless!</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>the pain you <i>do</i> experience from it does not typically last more than a day; it will likely hurt more the following evening than the night of the injection</dt>
