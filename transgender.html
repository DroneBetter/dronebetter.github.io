    <h2>subcutaneous injection administration guide</h2>
    <p>(written for me by my friend <abbr title="who does not wish for further clarification of her identity beyond her name">sophie</abbr>)</p>
    <p>Supplies needed:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Injection vial </dt>
      <dt>Insulin needles</dt>
      <dd>(recommended 29g 1ml/100 units, but like any insulin needle works)</dd>
      <dt>Sharps disposal bin</dt>
      <dt>70% isopropyl alcohol wipes</dt>
      <dt>Plasters</dt>
      <dd>(very optional)</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Before first ever injection, feel free to practice by injecting water into an orange</p>
    <p>Before injection:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Use 70% IPA wipe on vial stopper</dt>
      <dt>If you feel haven't showered in the past few days use 70% IPA wipe spiralling outwards where you would inject (optional)</dt>
      <dt>Remove the caps of the needle and draw air up to the amount you are injecting (25 units)</dt>
      <dt>Put the needle through the vial stopper</dt>
      <dt>Inject air into the vial</dt>
      <dt>Turn vial upside down</dt>
      <dt>Draw until there's enough fluid in the needle (might need to go up to like 40 units)</dt>
      <dt>Push the air and extra fluid in the needle back in to get to your actual dosage, feel free to tap the needle to help the air out whilst doing this</dt>
      <dt>Remove the needle</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>Injection:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>If you are particularly thin feel free to hold the skin so that you are easier to inject</dt>
      <dt>Push the needle into the injection site at a 45 degree angle oriented so that the bevel of the needle points up</dt>
      <dt>Inject</dt>
      <dt>Hold needle in for a few seconds</dt>
      <dt>Remove needle</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>After injection:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>If some injection fluid spills out don't worry it's not much, feel free to hold with your finger to stop it coming out</dt>
      <dt>If some blood spills out don't worry you just hit a capillary, feel free to hold with your finger to stop it coming out, you can use a plaster if you want</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>Do alternate injection sides (like switch between left and right)</p>
