    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>amateur programmer/mathematician and (as of 2025-26) third-year undergraduate maths student.</p>
    <p>(like many many others before me) I rediscovered the Stirling numbers (as coefficients of the change-of-basis matrix between \((x^n,)_n\) and \(({x\choose n},)_n\), about as soon as I learned about matrices in school), but had a tendency to skip the OEIS's <oeissectname>COMMENTS</oeissectname> sections and go straight to the <oeissectname>FORMULAS</oeissectname>.</p>
    <p>i then read Knuth's excellent 1992 writeup <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9205211v1><i>Two notes on notation</i></a>, which informed me that in fact these basis change coefficients are not just combinatorially interesting but also tools for finding other interesting combinatorial facts/identities with.</p>
    <p>since then, i have written quite a lot about them; my biggest OEISwiki page is <i><oeis-tally href=an_introduction_to_Stirling_numbers /></i>.</p>
    <p>i am trying to build a library in my userspage pages, on all the information i have which i don't know of other good resources upon. (They are not necessarily original, though a lot of them are; a lot of interesting original discoveries grew out of pages I originally expected to cover entirely known things.)</p>

          <p>the mainspace has been quite neglected, and the new <abbr title="the role acting as the highest authority in editorial disputes, that N. J. A. Sloane created to allow himself to retire from his de facto position doing that">Managing Editor</abbr> sees it as out-of-scope</p>
          <blockquote><p>I'm not a fan of "mainspace" Wiki and do not see them as a core part of the OEIS.  For explanatory information, Wikipedia is a better place. Rather I think of these pages as supporting any curious conventions that might exist in the OEIS and perhaps as a mechanism for linking the main sequence pages.  But that's just my personal opinion, not an "official" opinion whatever that might mean.  Most of us ignore the Wiki altogether, which means you are going to have a hard time finding someone prepared to review changes.  If you want to make changes there, I would suggest trying to find out the current author and interact with them.</p>
          <p>One more general warning is that at some point we are likely to drop <abbr title="MediaWiki alternative (which is mostly indistinguishable from a reader/editor perspective)">PmWiki</abbr> altogether and perhaps replace it with a simple markdown renderer. It's one of the most difficult pieces of our infrastructure to maintain. If that happens an effort will be made to preserve content, but the more exotic the features used the more likely the pages are to break if that transition does occur.</p></blockquote>

        <dt>ConwayLife</dt>
        <dd><p>when conducting preliminary investigations into CA growth rates for (what eventually grew into) my page <i><oeis-tally href="on_nearsighted_binary_counters" /></i>, i had <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/OCA_talk:Sqrt_replicator_rule#Incorrectness_of_name">some revelations</a> upon the "logarithmic" replicator rule's replicator's growth rate (actually sqrtic); i gave <a href="https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6240&p=171752#p171752">a brief history</a> and eventually the one who had mistakenly believed logarithmitude chimed in to say <a href="https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6240&p=172591#p172591">the rule's name should be changed</a>, so the rule's name was changed... splendid.</p>
          <p>note that my investigation was the easiest part; AforAmpere found the emulator that compresses the problem in space and time to make it fit in a Python one-liner, and I believe David Eppstein would have realised its growth rate during his investigations in the 1990s if he had that at his disposal too</p></dd>

            <p>i am ashamed to say i use this god damn piece of software, and that by succumbing to societal inertia i am making a small contribution to its enfurtherment. However, my usage of it has led to discovering <a href=https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/315308/circumventing-apparent-errors-in-integrate-and-nintegrate>a bug with a certain Laplace transform</a> where <tt>Integrate</tt> returns a value 1 lower than the truth given by <tt>NIntegrate</tt>, which Daniel Lichtblau filed as a bug.</p>
          <p>Also, I told my acquaintance the Wolfram employee xylochoron/<a href=https://esopsis.github.io/>esopsis</a>/Eric Parfitt about a mixed Mellin/Laplace transform which has a closed form for fixed integer \(m\) that it doesn't currently support,
            \[\int_{t=0}^\infty\frac{e^{-ty}}{(e^t-1)^m}t^{n-1}\ dt=\Gamma(n)\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}(-1)^{m-1-k}\left[{m+y\atop k+y+1}\right]_{y+1}\zeta(n-k,m+y)\]
            (giving some less contrived meaning to the <abbr title="or in this case, y+1-Stirling numbers; r is just used by convention">\(r\)-Stirling numbers</abbr>; see the footnote in <oeis-tally href="Stirling's_approximations#product_of_all_errors">this section</oeis-tally>), which they submitted as support ticket ID 465449.</p>

            <p>a defunct iOS platformer game in which you are an octopus-like creature, which (in addition to moving and jumping) can grapple while in the air, with a tentacle which acts like a rope.</p>
            <p>this can also be contracted, and contracting during a swing allows for acceleration via conservation of angular momentum. The ocmo operates in a "low gear" in that all its movements are slow but its contractions have a considerable amount of force behind them, which make the game's dynamics extremely interesting.</p>
            <p>i have been fond of it for <abbr title="cannot see exactly when i started playing on account of, but i think around 2018-19ish">a long time</abbr>, and posting speedruns on <a href=https://discord.gg/QSpyBtK>the Discord server</a> since my joining on 2021-11-01.</p>
            <p><details closed><summary>in early 2025, i began using a second finger to detach a grapple without lifting the first and ending the contraction early. (This technique had been discovered and understood (at least for braking) <a href=https://discord.com/channels/368348645382291466/691241596036972604/691516328284127262>as early as 2020-03-23</a>, but also evidently wasn't intended since it breaks the run playback feature and requires one to be screen-recording at all times)</summary>

              <blockquote>WOW. it is a new control mechanic that we did not design on purpose. It seems quite useful for extreme speedrunning. we were thinking of having a similar control but decided to leave it out as the control scheme was quite complicated already</blockquote>

            <p>there are 37 ordinary levels (with iCloud leaderboards still up!) in each the Light and Dark World (the former unlocked gradually as you progress, the latter being unlocked by <abbr title="i am biased by years of speedrunning but am pretty sure i achieved the third star's time on my first successful attempt basically always; for such a speedrunning-oriented game, the stars do not incentivise speed much! (it seems the developers erred extremely far on the cautious side to make it somewhat appealing to casual players)">3-starring</abbr> their LW <abbr title="somewhat of a misnomer; the Dark World's levels are sometimes harder variations of their LW parents (although Follow the Lead extends The World Outside with a new section) but mostly entirely independent; they made a lot of levels deemed too difficult for the main game, though their relegation hereto does not affect the care put into their construction and decoration!">counterparts</abbr>), together with four "stay alive" boss levels (not speedrunnable) and one "reach the end as fast as you want while being pursued" boss in the LW, and one considerably long and true serene final level in the DW; these last two could be speedrunnable but don't measure time automatically and have no builtin leaderboards so have largely not been.</p>
            <p>i currently have 2 of the 74 world records; <a href=https://youtu.be/e-JD-HELjlU>Ruins 2 <i>Keychain</i> in 22.10s</a> and <a href=https://youtu.be/bi65vyFnZsY>Sky 6 <i>Long Route</i> in 10.44s</a> (with <a href=https://youtu.be/biLQpNUJbUs>handcam</a>); these are both levels that the prodigious world champion <a href=https://space.bilibili.com/623735114>Xiaoyu (known to us as SXY3)</a> did not focus on, i have little doubt they could optimise further.</p>
            <p>i intend to eventually make a page here covering the speedrun WR history and remarks by the developer for every level, since there is a lot scattered across YouTube and bilibili or tucked away in that Discord server with poor searchability</p>
            <p>if it gets readded to the App Store or i start using an app-installing program (i think iMazing works), i will be able to reset it to try doing full-game speedruns, those seem as though they'd be fun (one has to optimise for consistency, which for me has entirely fallen by the wayside)</p>
