    <h1>DroneBetter's personal website</h1>
    <p>under construction; I have taken a few formatting things from others' websites I like, and am planning to take a lot more</p>
    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>amateur programmer/mathematician and (as of 2025-26) third-year undergraduate maths student.</p>
    <p>(like many many others before me) I rediscovered the Stirling numbers (as coefficients of the change-of-basis matrix between \((x^n,)_n\) and \(({x\choose n},)_n\), about as soon as I learned about matrices in school), but had a tendency to skip the OEIS's <oeissectname>COMMENTS</oeissectname> sections and go straight to the <oeissectname>FORMULAS</oeissectname>.</p>
    <p>i then read Knuth's excellent 1992 writeup <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9205211v1><i>Two notes on notation</i></a>, which informed me of these basis change coefficients' combinatorial interestingness, and (more importantly) their use as tools (in more regards than i could have imagined) for finding other interesting combinatorial facts.</p>
    <p>since then, i have written quite a lot about them; my biggest OEISwiki page is <i><oeis-tally href=an_introduction_to_Stirling_numbers /></i>.</p>
    <p>i am trying to build a library in my userspage pages, on all the information i have which i don't know of other good resources upon (or do but want to provide unifiedly in a way faster for me to retrieve from). (They are not necessarily original, though a lot of them are; a lot of interesting original discoveries grew out of pages I originally expected to collate entirely known things.)</p>
    <p>this website will be for smaller and miscellaneouser things; my goal state is that whenever i find a link that seems interesting, i will already have a page here that i can append it to for my later perusal</p>
    <details closed><summary>me</summary>
      <p>physically residing in the UK for now</p>
      <p>my humansona is <oeis-tally>Natalia L. Skirrow</oeis-tally> (i haven't decided what the L. will mean yet) and it is the general name to use for my corporeal form</p>
      <p>on the internet, i am ideally an it, but if you have only known me online i won't be upset at any other pronoun use</p>
      <p>being an it is unfortunately untenable in real life; i am somewhat averse to they due to the phenomenon of bigots using degendering as a tool for making trans women more palatable and have been subjected to too many bad-faith following of experimental they/themhood exclusively mixed in with accidental misgendering/deadnaming</p>
      <p>i consider myself spiritually adjacent to the people who use 'this one' instead of first-person pronouns but have not the wherewithal to do so</p>
      <!--<p>i have quite a few plural friends but thus far have not identified any statistically significant signs thereto in myself; however, if this changes i may be the kind to be really annoying about it and allocate typing quirks and trollsonas per headmate</p>
      <p>considering it entirely as a demedicalised model of consciousness, i guess i am not so opposed to the idea of compartmentalising facets of oneself but the requisite personifying</p>
      <p>i like to think an idealised version of me wouldn't have any ego, and the idea of working in a group so closely intertwined as to be effectively an indivisible unit for which individual attribution ceases to make sense (like how the Pythagoreans published their results anonymously) appeals to me, so maybe i would be considered reverse-plural</p>-->

          <p>the mainspace has been quite neglected, and the new <abbr title="the role acting as the highest authority in editorial disputes, that N. J. A. Sloane created to allow himself to retire from his de facto position doing that">Managing Editor</abbr> sees it as out-of-scope</p>
          <blockquote><p>I'm not a fan of "mainspace" Wiki and do not see them as a core part of the OEIS.  For explanatory information, Wikipedia is a better place. Rather I think of these pages as supporting any curious conventions that might exist in the OEIS and perhaps as a mechanism for linking the main sequence pages.  But that's just my personal opinion, not an "official" opinion whatever that might mean.  Most of us ignore the Wiki altogether, which means you are going to have a hard time finding someone prepared to review changes.  If you want to make changes there, I would suggest trying to find out the current author and interact with them.</p>
          <p>One more general warning is that at some point we are likely to drop <abbr title="MediaWiki alternative (which is mostly indistinguishable from a reader/editor perspective)">PmWiki</abbr> altogether and perhaps replace it with a simple markdown renderer. It's one of the most difficult pieces of our infrastructure to maintain. If that happens an effort will be made to preserve content, but the more exotic the features used the more likely the pages are to break if that transition does occur.</p></blockquote>

        <dd><p>when conducting preliminary investigations into CA growth rates for (what eventually grew into) my page <i><oeis-tally href="on_nearsighted_binary_counters" /></i>, i had <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/OCA_talk:Sqrt_replicator_rule#Incorrectness_of_name">some revelations</a> upon the "logarithmic" replicator rule's replicator's growth rate (actually sqrtic); i gave <a href="https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6240&p=171752#p171752">a brief history</a> and eventually the one who had mistakenly believed logarithmitude chimed in to say <a href="https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6240&p=172591#p172591">the rule's name should be changed</a>, so the rule's name was changed... splendid.</p>
        <p>note that my investigation was the easiest part; AforAmpere found the emulator that compresses the problem in space and time to make it fit in a Python one-liner, and I believe David Eppstein would have realised its growth rate during his investigations in the 1990s if he had that at his disposal too</p></dd>

          <p>a defunct iOS platformer game in which you are an octopus-like creature, which (in addition to moving and jumping) can grapple while in the air, with a tentacle which acts like a rope.</p>
          <p>this can also be contracted, and contracting during a swing allows for acceleration via conservation of angular momentum. The ocmo operates in a "low gear" in that all its movements are slow but its contractions have a considerable amount of force behind them, which make the game's dynamics extremely interesting.</p>
          <p>i have been fond of it for <abbr title="cannot see exactly when i started playing on account of, but i think around 2018-19ish">a long time</abbr>, and posting speedruns on <a href=https://discord.gg/QSpyBtK>the Discord server</a> since my joining on 2021-11-01.</p>
          <p><details closed><summary>in early 2025, i began using a second finger to detach a grapple without lifting the first and ending the contraction early.

          <p>i intend to eventually make a page here covering the speedrun WR history and remarks by the developer for every level, since there is a lot scattered across YouTube and bilibili or tucked away in that Discord server with poor searchability</p>
