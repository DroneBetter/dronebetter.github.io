    <title>reviews</title>
    <h1>reviews of textbooks/papers</h1>
    <p>this uses 'reviews' in a loose sense; mostly it will only consist of notes</p>
    <details closed><summary>Conway & Guy, <i>The Book of Numbers</i> (1996)</summary>
      <p>I like both of the authors but overall strongly dislike, in that it feels as though it dangles results above the reader's head without explaining the requisite tools to obtain them; it is a book for maths tourism, not a handbook.</p>
      <p>In particular, those I find most egregious/otherwise notable</p>
      <dl>
          <dt>p. 258, on harmonic numbers</dt>
          <dd>this is a rare moment of lucidity; they offer up a closed form for iterated partial sums of harmonic numbers, and a short proof for the first step of the induction. (Minor complaint: is nicer when expressed directly with multichoose)</dd>
          <dt>p. 260, on Euler-Mascheroni</dt>
          <dd>here, they state a variety of situations in which it arises, but not any of the ways to represent it computably based on these.</dd>
          <dt>p. 261, on Stirling's formula</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>one can refine Stirling's approximation with a power series, either by adding a finite number of terms from the Euler-Maclaurin series for \(\log(x!)\) <oe-is href=A046968></oe-is>/<oe-is href=A046969></oe-is> or from its exponential <oe-is href=A001163></oe-is>/<oe-is href=A001164></oe-is>. They use Stirling's approx. for \(8!=40320\), using the latter; \(\sqrt{\tau8}\left(\frac8e\right)^8\left(1+\frac1{12\cdot8}\right)=40318.045\ldots\) instead of \(\sqrt{\tau8}\left(\frac8e\right)^8e^{1\over12\cdot 8}=40320.217\ldots\); the next term in the Euler-Maclaurin series is \(-1\over360n^3\), while that of its exponential is \(1\over288n^2\); at \(n=8\) this predicts the original version to have 1/10th the error, and indeed, its actual error is 8.974 times smaller. It becomes superior for \(n>1.493579\ldots\); why do they use one that is less precise and longer to write?</p>
            <p>this is also an example of the phrasing typical of them;</p>
            <blockquote><p>A more exact form of Stirling's formula augments it proportionally by the fraction \(1/12n\)</p></blockquote>
            <p>'augments proportionally' sounds like an overly-literal translation of Euclid that turns lucid Greek into horribly encumbersome and ambiguous English, and there is again a horrible lack of details here.</p>
