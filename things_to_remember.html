    <h1>things to remember</h1>
    <p>things I cannot act on now but would like to when it becomes possible</p>
    <details open><summary>things to do if i become a professor and make lectures</summary>
      <p>(based on the things i disliked being omitted from those i sat in)</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>for first-year teaching of sequences and series, convergence, etc., go on a detour upon getting to the harmonic numbers</dt>
        <dd><dl>
          <dt>show Euler's factorisation \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s}=\prod_{p\in\mathbb P}\frac1{1-p^{-s}}\), and that if \(p_n\le c^n\) then the product is \(\le\frac1{(c^{-1};c^{-1})_\infty}=\frac1{\phi(c^{-1})}\) (the reciprocal of the <wi-ki href=Euler_function></wi-ki>)</dt>
          <dd>the Euler function is finite within the unit disk and zero along its boundary, so the infinitude of \(\zeta(1)\) implies \(p_n\in o((1+\epsilon)^n)\) (primes growslower than exponentially)</dd>
          <dt>then show theorem 1.13 on p.18 of Apostol's <i>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</i> (1976), on divergence of sum of reciprocals of primes</dt>
          <dd>by assuming primes are bounded below by a polynomial (\(\rightarrow\) monomial as one considers arbitrarily distant tail sums) \(p_n\ge c_0n^{c_1}\) with \(c_1>1\), one can bound the sum above by \(\frac{\zeta(c_1)}{c_0}\); divergence contradicts this, so primes are \(p_n\in o(n^{1+\epsilon})\).</dd>
          <dt>maybe then also give the weak prime number theorem, from my page on <oeis-tally href="Stirling's_approximations"></oeis-tally> (the sum-integral-inequality-based formulation of which could also fit in such a course)</dt>
        </dl></dd>
        <dt>for second-year teaching of multivariable calculus, start with explanation of DFT, then Chebyshev polynomials as charpoly of path graph's adj. matrix, then explain contents of <oeis-tally href=chessboards#the_fourierful_king_of_chebyshev></oeis-tally> (as a derivation of heat flow on a copper plane (surrounded by always-constant-temperature void) in the case that both space and time are discrete, before then covering the doubly-continuous case).</dt>
        <dd>this would also fit in a linear algebra class, since (after finding the eigenvectors) it uses the spectral theorem to provide the coefficients that change from the basis of piece-amplitudes across squares to the eigenbasis</dd>
      </dl>
    </details>
    <details open><summary>things I want others to do but don't know who to contact (perhaps the reader can help)</summary>
      <dl>
        <dt>get the University of Waterloo to digitise its old CORR research reports in a single open-access webpage (and fix all the old links that became defunct)</dt>
        <dd>I have borrowed a <i>physical copy</i> (delivered <i>across the Atlantic</i> at <i>Â£20 expense</i>) of <abbr title="Ronald C. Read, September 26, 1991. <i>Graphical enumeration by cycle-index sums: first steps toward a unified treatment</i>">CORR 91-19</abbr>, which i intend to write a review of (a <i>very</i> thorough one, in the manner of <a href=https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2005-42-02/S0273-0979-05-01043-8/S0273-0979-05-01043-8.pdf>this wonderful review</a> of <i>On quaternions and octonions</i> by John C. Baez)</dd>
        <dt>get Stanford University to include scans of the research reports that it currently only offers mangled by destructive OCR</dt>
        <dd><p>specifically, I found <a href=http://infolab.stanford.edu/TR/CS-TR-82-949.html>this report</a> (a very good introduction to the \(r\)-Stirling numbers), which was also funded by the Office of Naval Research, which means it has <a href=https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA123472.pdf>an upload</a> (as a direct scan!) at the Defen<abbr title="grrr (i am British)">s</abbr>e Technical Information Centre</p>
        <p>I have seen an extremely similar effect (right down to the mismatched page widths) happen to the most common (and maybe only?) free copy of Bruce C. Berndt's <i>Ramanujan's Notebooks</i> accessible on the internet; some uploads' filenames seem to imply it was converted from .djvu, so perhaps the same happened inadvertently here</p>
        <p>the same problem seems to persist across between some and all of the papers in <a href=http://infolab.stanford.edu/TR>the directory page</a></p></dd>
