    <h1>things to remember</h1>
    <p>things I cannot/oughtn't act on now but would like to when it becomes possible</p>
    <details open><summary>things to do if i become a professor and make lectures</summary>
      <p>(based on the things i disliked being omitted from those i sat in)</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>for first-year teaching of sequences and series, convergence, etc., go on a detour upon getting to the example of harmonic numbers</dt>
        <dd><dl>
          <dt><i>Concrete Mathematics</i> p.277 gives a cool formulation due to Euler</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>use \(\log\frac k{k-1}=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac1{ik^i}\) so (telescoping) \(\log\frac n1=\sum_{k=2}^n\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac1{ik^i}\); transposing gives \(\log n=\sum_{i=1}^\infty{H^{(i)}_n-1\over i}\), so letting \(n\to\infty\), \(\log n-H_n=\sum_{i=2}^\infty{H^{(i)}_n-1\over i}\sim\sum_{i=2}^\infty{\zeta(i)-1\over i}\), we can then use that \(-H_{-x}=\sum_{i=2}^\infty\zeta(i)x^{i-1}\) (see <oeis-tally href=an_introduction_to_Stirling_numbers/more_on_Faulhabernoulli_and_Gregory#more_log-gamma_series_things>this section</oeis-tally> for a discussion) to turn it into \[\log\infty-H_\infty=\lim_{x\to1}\left(\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{\zeta(i)x^i}i=\int_0^x-H_{-t}\,dt\overset{(*)}=\log((-x)!)-\gamma x\right)-\log\frac1{1-x}=\lim_{x\to0}\log\big(x\Gamma(x)\big)-\gamma\overset{(\dagger)}=-\gamma\], since \(\Gamma\)'s pole at \(0\) has residue \(1\).</p>
            <p>the \((*)\) step follows directly from \(\gamma:=-\Gamma'(1),{d\over dx}\log\Gamma(x)=H_{x-1}-\gamma\) (from logarithmically differentiating \(\Gamma\)'s recurrence relation), and \((\dagger)\) from \(\underset{x=0}{\mathrm{res}}\,\Gamma(x)=1\)</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>show Euler's factorisation \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s}=\prod_{p\in\mathbb P}\frac1{1-p^{-s}}\), and that if \(p_n\le c^n\) then the product is \(\le\frac1{(c^{-1};c^{-1})_\infty}=\frac1{\phi(c^{-1})}\) (the reciprocal of the <wi-ki href=Euler_function></wi-ki>)</dt>
          <dd>the Euler function is finite within the unit disk and zero along its boundary, so the infinitude of \(H_\infty=\zeta(1)\) implies \(p_n\in o((1+\epsilon)^n)\) (primes grow slower than exponentially)</dd>
          <dt>then show theorem 1.13 on p.18 of Apostol's <i>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</i> (1976), on divergence of sum of reciprocals of primes</dt>
          <dd>by assuming primes are bounded below by a polynomial (\(\rightarrow\) monomial as one considers arbitrarily distant tail sums) \(p_n\ge c_0n^{c_1}\) with \(c_1>1\), one can bound the sum above by \(\frac{\zeta(c_1)}{c_0}\); divergence contradicts this, so primes are \(p_n\in o(n^{1+\epsilon})\).</dd>
          <dt>maybe then also give the weak prime number theorem, from my page on <oeis-tally href="Stirling's_approximations"></oeis-tally> (much of which could also fit in such a course)</dt>
        </dl></dd>
        <dt>for second-year teaching of multivariable calculus, start with explanation of DFT, then Chebyshev polynomials as charpoly of path graph's adj. matrix (can be done quite easily via cofactor expansion!), then explain contents of <oeis-tally href=chessboards#the_fourierful_king_of_chebyshev></oeis-tally> (as a derivation of heat flow on a copper plane (surrounded by always-constant-temperature void) in the case that both space and time are discrete, before then covering the doubly-continuous case)</dt>
        <dd>this would also fit in a linear algebra class, since (after finding the eigenvectors) it uses the spectral theorem to provide the coefficients that change from the basis of piece-amplitudes across squares to the eigenbasis</dd>
        <dt>if ever i teach a statistics course (heaven forbid), <a href=https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/embl_pboc_2023/assets/pdfs/london_bombs.pdf>this 1946 paper</a> on the distribution of V-2 bombs across London could be a nice example for the effectiveness of the law of large numbers (and the tendency of humans to see incidental clustering in random distributions as evidence of nonrandomness)</dt>
        <dt>for 2nd-to-3rd teaching of methods for asymptoterating functions via complex analysis, <a href=matrix.html>the matrix page</a>'s section <b>coin survival</b> is a good motivating example for why one would want to compute the inverse binomial transform of a rapidly-converging sequence (and thereby need to get around the numerical instability via eg. the <wi-ki href=Nørlund–Rice_integral></wi-ki>)</dt>
      </dl>
    </details>
    <details closed><summary>things I want others to do but don't know who to contact (perhaps the reader can help)</summary>
      <dl>
        <dt>get the University of Waterloo to digitise its old CORR research reports in a single open-access webpage (and fix all the old links that became defunct)</dt>
        <dd>I have borrowed a <i>physical copy</i> (delivered <i>across the Atlantic</i> at <i>£20 expense</i>) of <abbr title="Ronald C. Read, September 26, 1991. <i>Graphical enumeration by cycle-index sums: first steps toward a unified treatment</i>">CORR 91-19</abbr>, which i intend to write a review of (a <i>very</i> thorough one, in the manner of <a href=https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2005-42-02/S0273-0979-05-01043-8/S0273-0979-05-01043-8.pdf>this wonderful review</a> of <i>On quaternions and octonions</i> by John C. Baez)</dd>
        <dt>get Stanford University to include scans of the research reports that it currently only offers mangled by destructive OCR</dt>
        <dd><p>specifically, I found <a href=http://infolab.stanford.edu/TR/CS-TR-82-949.html>this report</a> (a very good introduction to the \(r\)-Stirling numbers), which was also funded by the Office of Naval Research, which means it has <a href=https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA123472.pdf>an upload</a> (as a direct scan!) at the Defen<abbr title="grrr (i am British)">s</abbr>e Technical Information Centre</p>
        <p>I have seen an extremely similar effect (right down to the mismatched page widths) happen to the most common (and maybe only?) free copy of Bruce C. Berndt's <i>Ramanujan's Notebooks</i> accessible on the internet; some uploads' filenames seem to imply it was converted from .djvu, so perhaps the same happened inadvertently here</p>
        <p>the same problem seems to persist across [between some and all] of the papers in <a href=http://infolab.stanford.edu/TR>the directory page</a></p></dd>
      </dl>
    </details>
    <details open><summary>things to do when i'm not procrastinating on so many obligations that they would serve to further distract from</summary>
      <p>(who am i kidding; i am so procrastinatory as-is that it would probably not meaningfully alter my obligation-productivity)</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>make a page about all the fun corollaries that come out of viewing hypergeometric theorems (à la Gauss's) through multiple lenses (slightly similarly to <i><oeis-tally href=a_nicer_hypergeometric_formulation></oeis-tally></i>); <a href=https://math.stackexchange.com/q/2735437>this answer of mine</a> employs Ruben's theorem, there are surely many more; also, it seems likely to have been already known before 1965</dt>
        <dt><s>make a Wikipedia page about Euler's tree function as a more generating-function-focused counterpart of the one on the Lambert W function, with things like the expansion of \(\frac1{(1-T(x))^n}\) covered in <a href=https://math.stackexchange.com/a/5114687>this answer of mine</a></s> partially done, <oeis-tally href="Euler's_tree_function"></oeis-tally></dt>
        <dt>relatedly, make a page about Ramanujan's Q function; some of the history of its historical consideration (Cauchy, Ramanujan, Riordan, Knuth) is detailed in that answer, though not Knuth's <abbr title="note it cites the Cauchy reference correctly as its earliest publication Exercices de mathématiques, but uses page numbers as it appears in Œuvres complètes vol. 6"><a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/0196-6774(85)90037-9><i>An analysis of optimum caching</i></a></abbr> (which is where I learned of the others); also, Flajolet et al.'s <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/0377-0427(93)E0258-N><i>On Ramanujan's Q-function</i></a></dt>
        <dt>make a wiki about maths theorems/results that lists (and gives some exposition of) corollaries of each one (or statements that are (perhaps with some manipulation) equivalent), focusing on little-known ones specifically</dt>
        <dd><p>for instance,</p><dl>
          <dt>the above examples with Stirling's approximation and the spectral theorem (being all you need to transform distributions of chess pieces on reflexive graphs into eigenbases) are pretty good!</dt>
          <dt>how Fenwick trees are useful for tasks both combinatorial (see <oeis-tally href=Stirling_factoradics></oeis-tally>) and numerical</dt>
          <dd>if you have a list of floats all about the same size, adding them onto a single accumulator one-at-a-time while minimising roundoff error is hard (and requires storing additional bits to do perfectly), but making a Fenwick tree then extracting the total sum from that is of course much better than adding them onto an accumulator one at a time; it took me an embarrassingly long time to realise the latter application after only thinking about them for the former</dd>
          <dt>an entry about the Riemann integral would contain (at least) the two genres of 'nontrivial' integral i know to be obtainable directly through it;</dt>
          <dd><dl>
            <dt>plugging in Gauss's multiplication theorem is the easiest route's to Binet's log-gamma theorem (covered in <oeis-tally href="Stirling's_approximations"></oeis-tally>)</dt>
            <dt><oeis-tally href=chessboards/more_pathery></oeis-tally>, in which a sum's closed form (a sum of nth powers) is calculable as a trace (interpreting powers' bases as eigenvalues of a circulant matrix, which is isomorphic to coeff extraction from polynomial exponentiation mod \(1-x^n\)); this converges to the integral's final value exactly (when the length of <abbr title="of which the matrix is the adjacency matrix">the cycle graph</abbr> exceeds the length of the paths enumerated)</dt>
          </dl></dd>
        </dl><p>this is somewhat similar to Pólya and Szegő's <i>Problems and Theorems in Analysis</i> (1925) and the <a href=http://www.tricki.org><abbr title="a wiki of tricks">tricki</abbr></a> (2008), whose intentions are to index problems by genre of solution type and solutions by genres of problem applicability, respectively</p></dd>
        <dt>maybe a wiki oriented around 'frequently-asked questions' (ie. counterexamples demonstrating why things don't have properties that might be intuitively expected of them but aren't mentioned in textbooks/Wikipedia articles)</dt>
        <dd>like "does the shape of the row echelon form \(R(M)\), as a tableaux, relate to a matrix \(M\)'s isomorphism class in any nontrivial way (beyond its height) like Jordan normal form?" "no, but the height of a column tells you the rank of \(M\)'s corresponding upper-left submatrix"</dd>
        <dt>make a LifeWiki page on the <a href=https://mathoverflow.net/a/412793>bootstrap percolation</a> von Neumann CA B234/S01234 (see also <a href=https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-probability/volume-18/issue-3/Slow-convergence-in-bootstrap-percolation/10.1214/07-AAP473.pdf>this paper</a> analysing the rate of convergence (by the author of the webpage linked from that answer) and <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3097>this paper</a> on the higher-dimensional cases)</dt>
        <dd>note that this is not the only famous CA in the von Neumann neighbourhood; there is also <wi-ki href="Toom's_rule"></wi-ki> (where cells flip to state \(s\) if the cells above and right are both \(s\)) and the <wi-ki href=Ulam–Warburton_automaton></wi-ki> (covered in <a href=https://conwaylife.com/wiki/OCA:H-trees>H-trees</a>)</dd>
        <dt>expound upon cool result (3.1.10) of <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1856>this nice paper on Euler-Mascheroni</a> and incorporate into <oeis-tally href="Stirling's_approximations"></oeis-tally></dt>
        <dt>investigate \(r\)-(numbers <oeis-tally href=above_the_Stirling_triangles></oeis-tally>); <a href=https://math.stackexchange.com/a/5123670>this answer</a> shows that \(B^+_n=-n\zeta(1-n)=\sum_{k=0}^n{k!\over k+1}(-1)^k{1+n\brace1+k}\) can be continued to negative \(n\), likewise for \(B(n,v)=-n\zeta(1-n,v)=\sum_{k=0}^n{k!\over k+1}(-1)^k{n+v\brace k+1}_v\)</dt>
        <dt>update list of sequences via Q function in <i><oeis-tally href="Euler's_tree_function" /></i> with <oe-is href=A089901></oe-is>(n) \(=n^n(n+Q(n)+1)\)</dt>
        <dt>page about facts in number theory with many proofs; ie. divergence of sum of reciprocals of primes (of which i know three; Euler's (given on <wi-ki href=Divergence_of_the_sum_of_the_reciprocals_of_the_primes>the Wikipedia page</wi-ki>), the one Apostol aforementionedly presents in <i>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</i> (1976), Monson's from <a href=https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2016/REUPapers/Monson.pdf><i>Finite Fourier analysis and Dirichlet's theorem</i></a> (2015))</dt>
        <dt>essay on the factorial being better than the gamma function with reference to various identities (which i will try to remember to collect here until i split it off)</dt>
        <dd>Ramanujan's integral (<a href=https://dlmf.nist.gov/5.13.E4>DLMF 5.13.4</a>) is much nicer as \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty{dt\over(a+t)!(b+t)!(c-t)!(d-t)!}={(a+b+c+d)!\over(a+c)!(a+d)!(b+c)!(b+d)!}\)</dd>
